ShopFast E-Commerce Site

This site was created to demonstrate the knowledge and skills to create a E-Commerce Site:

1. Utilized ASP.NET Core MVC for building a web application with a strong separation of concerns (Model, View, Controller).

2. Implemented user authentication and authorization using Identity, including registration and login functionality.

3. Designed and developed a shopping cart system with features such as adding and removing items, displaying cart items, and calculating total prices.

4. Created a checkout process that allows users to input shipping and payment information, and stores the data in a database.

5. Implemented data persistence using Entity Framework Core, including creating and updating a database schema through migrations.

6. Built a responsive and user-friendly interface using Bootstrap and Razor Views.


Current functionality allows a user to register, log in, add/remove items from a cart, show current items and total, create an order, and purchase an order. In order to demonstrate the functionality in a quick way, validation on entered data is minimal (valid credit card, email address, etc... not needed to test functionality).
